                <p id="verse"> Summer went away, still, the yearning stays</p>
                <p id="verse"> I play it cool with the best of them</p>
                <p id="verse"> I wait patiently, he's gonna notice me</p>
                <p id="verse"> It's okay, we're the best of friends</p>
                <p id="verse"> Anyway</p>
                <p id="verse"> I hear it in your voice, you're smoking with your boys</p>
                <p id="verse"> I touch my phone as if it's your face</p>
                <p id="verse"> I didn't choose this town, I dream of getting out</p>
                <p id="verse"> There's just one who could make me stay</p>
                <p id="verse"> All my days</p>

                <h3 class ="white">Pre-Chorus</h3>
                <p id="pcline">From sprinkler splashes to fireplace ashes</p>
                <p id="pcline">I waited ages to see you there</p>
                <p id="pcline">I search the party of better bodies</p>
                <p id="pcline">Just to learn that you never cared</p>

                <p id="pcline">From sprinkler splashes to fireplace ashes</p>
                <p id="pcline">I gave my blood, sweat, and tears for this</p>
                <p id="pcline">I hosted parties and starved my body</p>
                <p id="pcline">Like I'd be saved by a perfect kiss</p>
                <p id="pcline">The jokes weren't funny, I took the money</p>
                <p id="pcline">My friends from home don't know what to say</p>
                <p id="pcline">I looked around in a blood-soaked gown</p>
                <p id="pcline">And I saw something they can't take away</p>
                <p id="pcline">'Cause there were pages turned with the bridges burned</p>
                <p id="pcline">Everything you lose is a step you take</p>
                <p id="pcline">So, make the friendship bracelets, take the moment and taste it</p>
                <p id="pcline">You've got no reason to be afraid</p>
