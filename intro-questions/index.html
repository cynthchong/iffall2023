        <h1>Introductory Questions</h1>

        <ol type="1">
            <li>My name is Cynthia Chong. My major is Marketing, and I'm a junior.</li>
            <li>I have a minor in HCI and am looking forward to learning more about web design and HTML/CSS coding.</li>
            <li>I don't have any experience with HTML, CSS, or JS.</li>
            <li>I hope to learn what makes a great, well-designed website and how to code one.</li>
            <li>Everything is smaller on a screen than on paper, so I think making sure the design of everything is 
                visually appealling and comfortable to view on screen is going to be important.</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.rollienation.com/" target="_blank">Rollie Nation website</a>
                <p>I love the design of this website because I think it's bold, fun, 
                yet simple and easy to read. The design elements show cohesive branding, like the rounded corners and 
                circles you can find throughout the website and a consistent typeface. It also uses more advanced website 
                techniques when it shows how a shoe is made. It's a nice visual touch that succinctly explains their shoe production
                process in a visually appealing and intriguing way.</p></li>
            <li><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/" target="_blank">New York Times website</a>
                <p>Even though the NYTimes home page has tons of information being communicated
                to readers at once, the way the page is laid out in sections help viewers quickly digest and find the stories
                they want to read. For example, the top section is clearly for today's top headlines, there's an Opinion column
                on the right, a 2024 election section, an Awards Season section, and more. </p></li>
            <li><a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/" target="_blank">FiveThirtyEight website</a> <p>The FiveThirtyEight website has all the features needed when finding
                and viewing polls. It includes features like a last updated timestamp, filters so users can find the right poll,
                color codes and legends that indicate what the colors means, and a selection of the most popular polls on top. I think
                the website designers thought through what important features the user might want and use, resulting in a site that is
                easy to use and navigate.
