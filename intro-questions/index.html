        <h1>Introductory Questions</h1>

        <ol type="1">
            <li><b>Provide your name, major, year in school (sophomore, junior, etc).</b><br> 
                My name is Cynthia Chong. My major is Marketing, and I'm a junior.</li>
            <br><li><b>Tell us a bit about your background and what prompted you to take this class.</b><br>
                I have a minor in HCI and am looking forward to learning more about web design and HTML/CSS coding.</li>
            <br><li><b>Do you have any experience with HTML/CSS/JS? If so, tell us a bit about it.</b><br>
                I don't have any experience with HTML, CSS, or JS.</li>
            <br> <li><b>Name one thing you hope to learn in this class.</b><br>
                I hope to learn what makes a great, well-designed website and how to code one.</li>
            <br> <li><b>Name one way you expect designing for screen to be different from designing for paper.</b><br>
                Everything is smaller on a screen than on paper, so I think making sure the design of everything is<br> 
                visually appealling and comfortable to view on screen is going to be important.</li>
            <br><li><b>Provide a link to a website you think exemplifies effective design. Explain your choice.</b><br>
                <a href="https://www.rollienation.com/" target="_blank"><b>Rollie Nation website</b></a>
                <p>I love the design of this website because I think it's bold, fun, 
                yet simple and easy to read. The design elements <br>
                show cohesive branding, like the rounded corners and circles you can find throughout the website and a consistent typeface. <br> 
                It also uses more advanced website techniques when it shows how a shoe is made. It's a nice visual touch that succinctly <br> 
                explains their shoe production process in a visually appealing and intriguing way.</p></li>
            <br><li><b>Provide a link to a website you think exemplifies effective communication. Explain your choice.</b><br>
                <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/" target="_blank"><b>New York Times website</b></a>
                <p>Even though the NYTimes home page has tons of information being communicated to readers at once, the way the page <br> is laid out in sections help viewers quickly digest and find the stories
                they want to read. For example, the top section <br> is clearly for today's top headlines, there's an Opinion column
                on the right, a 2024 election section, an Awards Season <br> section, and more. </p></li>
            <br><li><b>Provide a link to a website you think works well. Explain your choice.</b><br>
                <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/" target="_blank"><b>FiveThirtyEight website</b></a> <p>The FiveThirtyEight website has all the features needed when finding
                and viewing polls. It includes features <br> like a last updated timestamp, filters so users can find the right poll,
                color codes and legends that indicate <br> 
                what the colors means, and a selection of the most popular polls on top. I think
                the website designers thought through <br> 
                what important features the user might want and use, resulting in a site that is easy to use and navigate.
